### 🌟 About Me

I'm a passionate and curious Computer Science graduate from **Northern Arizona University**, currently working as a **Research Assistant** on AI Security. My research focuses on the **vulnerabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)** — particularly **prompt injection attacks**, and how to build safer, more robust LLMs.

---

### 🚀 What I Do

- 🔬 **Research Assistant** working on adversarial testing of LLMs and prompt injection attacks.
- 🤖 Build ML/NLP models that interpret, classify, and explain real-world data.
- 🧠 Fine-tune and distill transformer-based models for tone and emotion prediction.
- 📱 Designed and evaluated ML-based Android malware detection systems.
