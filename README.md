### Hi there, I'm Teja-Pravallika 👋

I’m a Computer Science graduate with a strong interest in Machine Learning and Data Science. I love working on meaningful, data-driven challenges and building intelligent systems that create impact.

- 👩‍💻 Currently working as a **Research Assistant**, exploring **prompt injection attacks in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)** and enhancing LLM security through adversarial testing and prompt engineering.
- 👀 Interested in **Machine Learning**, **Data Science**, **LLM Safety & Evaluation**, and **Computer Vision**.
- 🌱 Actively learning about **ML model interpretability**, **model robustness**, and **advanced neural architectures**.
- 💞️ Looking to collaborate on **AI/ML research projects**, especially those focused on **LLMs**, **cybersecurity**, or **real-world applications of ML**.
- 📫 Reach me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/teja-pravallika-nandamuri-81b600262/)
- 😄 Pronouns: She/Her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I once built a tone prediction system for movies using LLMs just for fun—and turned it into a high-performing emotion classifier with 95% accuracy!
